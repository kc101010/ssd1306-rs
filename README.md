# SSD1306-rs

Project based on my previous [SSD1306 Linux Driver](https://github.com/kc101010/Embedded-Training/tree/main/Embedded%20Training/I2C%20OLED%20driver/i2c_OLED), but re-written in Rust.

Bit of a stepping stone to gaining more experience with Rust.

Demonstrates;
+ General Rust concepts/programming
+ Embedded Rust
+ Unit Testing
+ Automated building via GitHub
+ Built-in documentation via rustdoc
